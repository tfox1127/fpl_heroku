Use of a chip (Triple Captain, Bench Boost, Wildcard, Free Hit) is permitted at any time in any competition to help improve your score but be aware that chip use is the first tiebreaker if matchup results in a tie.  Points hits (-4, -8, etc.) for additional transfers are not included in the score for any side games so can be used as a tactic to help improve your chances but be aware that the overall league score (managed on the official website) does take these hits into account so your league position may be impacted.<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>Use of a chip (team that did not use one will progress); if still tied</li>
  <li>Highest team score excluding player whose points were multiplied (either captain or vice-captain if captain did not play); if still tied</li>
  <li>Team with worst league position will progress</li>
