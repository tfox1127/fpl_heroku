      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12"></p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The European Cup competitions come to a conclusion with wins for RC Aikens in the Champion's League and Ed Tierney in the Europa League - Congrats to both who take home $300 and $150 respectively.

      <h2>Week 33+ Update</h2>

      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">GW33+ is over, GW34+ is starting tomorrow, no rest with this crazy schedule!</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Congrats to Forrest for this week's Manager of the Week - a great score of 80 in a relatively low scoring week with triple captain Mane delivering.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">GW33+ also saw the conclusion of the European Cup semi finals, with Ryan and RC going through in the Champions League and Ed and Ray making the final in the Europa League.  RC and Andy had an extremely close semi final, with it having to be settled on the captain tiebreaker.  </p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Good luck to Ryan, RC, Ray and Ed in the final - don't forget the final is only 1 leg and will be decided in GW34+.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The conclusion of GW34+ will also give us our brackets for the Last Chance Saloon competition.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The Tier 2 competition will be made up of those positioned in the league as at the end of GW34+ in 15th to 26th places, with 15th through 18th getting a bye into the Quarter Finals.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Unless something drastic happens, the Tier 1 competition will likely be comprised of those positioned 4th through 14th in the league as at the conclusion of GW34+ (the exact criteria is anyone in 14th or above that is 75 points or more behind the league leader).  If that is the case, we will have 11 entrants which will mean that places 4th through 8th will get a bye into the Quarter Finals.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Good luck everyone, don't forget the deadline tomorrow at 11am CST / 5pm BST!</p>
