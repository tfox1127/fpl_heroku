      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12"></p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The penultimate week is over and only 4 days until the season is over.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Congrats to Ray Bleth for winning this week's manager of the week with a big score of 86 after captaining Sterling for his 17 point haul.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Congrats to Tom Fox and RC Aikens for advancing to the final of LCS Tier 1 beating out Mike Doherty and Aaron Grala.  Congrats to Mikael Nilsson and Mik Malo for defeating Luke/Kevin L and Syed in the Tier 2 competition.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The finals will be played on Sunday with winners receiving $200 and $150 respectively for the Tier 1 and 2 cups.  Good luck everyone!</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The league will also be decided on Sunday with Ed currently 16 points ahead of Ryan and 45 points ahead of me.  RC also with an outside chance of making top 3 - prizes of $600, $350 and $200 will go to 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively after Sunday's games.  Good luck all!</p>

      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Looking forward to seeing Leeds and West Brom in the PL next year - congrats to Chris Parkin who is a big Leeds fan, it's been a long wait!  I'm hoping Swansea can join them through the Playoffs after a crazy final day in the Championship today.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Good luck in the final gameweek everyone - it's usually a crazy last day so strap in and enjoy the madness. Lots of interesting football to watch with Top 4 and Relegation still wide open.</p>

      <h6>2020-07-18</h6>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12"></p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12"></p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Another Gameweek over and yet another beginning tomorrow.  A relatively low scoring gameweek saw Ed Tierney win Manager of the Week with a great score of 66 with his Free Hit - congrats Ed.  Ed and Ryan are in a close battle for the league with only two weeks left!</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">LCS Quarter Finals are also complete - congrats to Tom, Mike D, Aaron and RC for making it through to the Tier 1 semis.  Congrats to Luke/Kevin, Michael, Mike M and Syed for making it through to the Tier 2 semi finals.  Commiserations to those that lost out this week.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The semi finals will be played in GW37+, which kicks off tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">This is the penultimate week, so if you still have chips left, there are only 2 weeks left to play them (and you can only play 1 in each week!).</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">It's been extremely fast paced since the restart so great work if you've managed to keep up - I know I have found it tough.  Next season should be a much more relaxed schedule, almost back to normal so don't worry if you are struggling to keep up, you're not alone!</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Good luck in these last 2 weeks, the final games are the following Sunday so not long left now!</p>

      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Only 3 gameweeks left, which will all be played in the next 2 weeks - good luck all for the rest of the season!</p>

      <h2>Week 33+ Update</h2>

      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">GW33+ is over, GW34+ is starting tomorrow, no rest with this crazy schedule!</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Congrats to Forrest for this week's Manager of the Week - a great score of 80 in a relatively low scoring week with triple captain Mane delivering.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">GW33+ also saw the conclusion of the European Cup semi finals, with Ryan and RC going through in the Champions League and Ed and Ray making the final in the Europa League.  RC and Andy had an extremely close semi final, with it having to be settled on the captain tiebreaker.  </p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Good luck to Ryan, RC, Ray and Ed in the final - don't forget the final is only 1 leg and will be decided in GW34+.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The conclusion of GW34+ will also give us our brackets for the Last Chance Saloon competition.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">The Tier 2 competition will be made up of those positioned in the league as at the end of GW34+ in 15th to 26th places, with 15th through 18th getting a bye into the Quarter Finals.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Unless something drastic happens, the Tier 1 competition will likely be comprised of those positioned 4th through 14th in the league as at the conclusion of GW34+ (the exact criteria is anyone in 14th or above that is 75 points or more behind the league leader).  If that is the case, we will have 11 entrants which will mean that places 4th through 8th will get a bye into the Quarter Finals.</p>
      <p class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">Good luck everyone, don't forget the deadline tomorrow at 11am CST / 5pm BST!</p>
